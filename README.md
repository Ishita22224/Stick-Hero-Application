# Stick-Hero-Application
Stick Hero Game - implementation using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The game emulates the core mechanics of Stick Hero.
## Introduction:
Implementing a game inspired by Stick Hero using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Your game should emulate the core mechanics of Stick Hero while adding your own creative twist. 

## Game Summary:
A game where a character named stick-hero traverses between platforms by stretching out a stick. The stick has to be of exact length or the character will fall down. The character can collect the reward (cherries) while reaching the goal.

## Dependancy:
1. Change the path in the GamePageController line 281, please put the actual path, ot the relative path.
2. The path can be found under src->main->resources->application.stickhero->assets->cherry2.png

## How to play:
1. Stick increases by pressing and hosting the space bar
2. The hero inverts to get cherries by pressing the down arrow button. It stays inverted for as long as the button is pressed, it comes back to its normal state when down arrow button is released.

## Things we have done:
1. Design Patterns - Singleton on player, mainpage and exitpage. Builder for Stick (StickBuilder).
2. Junit testing has been done.
3. Multithreading has been done(bonus part).
